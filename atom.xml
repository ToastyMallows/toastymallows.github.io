    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 8.1 and I noticed that my system would beep loudly or ring its system bell when I scrolled my mouse wheel really fast.  I think that it is compounded by the fact that I have a <a href="http://support.logitech.com/product/gaming-mouse-g500">gaming mouse</a>, which allows me to spin the scroll wheel to simulate infinite scrolling.  Here&rsquo;s how to turn it off in Windows 8.1.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open Registry Edit (Win + R, type regedit, hit enter)</li>
  <li>Navigate to <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Beep</code></li>
  <li>Double click on the key <code>Start</code></li>
  <li>Change the value from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>4</strong></li>
  <li>Reboot</li>
</ol>

<p>Now when you scroll your scroll wheel really quickly, you won&rsquo;t hear that annoying beep anymore!  I&rsquo;m still not sure exactly what causes the beep, because it only happens in some applications.  For example, it won&rsquo;t happen in Google Chrome if I scroll on a webpage really quickly, but it will happen if I scroll inside of Spotify.  If anyone has more information abot this I&rsquo;d be curious to hear what it is!</p>

    <link href="http://toastymallows.github.io/linux-mint-cinnamon-right-click-menu-file-shredder/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-06T02:08:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://toastymallows.github.io/linux-mint-cinnamon-right-click-menu-file-shredder</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently switched my main desktop computer over to a 100% Linux machine.  One thing that I really liked in Windows was the <a href="http://www.fileshredder.org/">File Shredder</a> application that added a nice option the right click menu in Windows Explorer to shred or &ldquo;securely delete&rdquo; the selected files and folders. So I recreated that functionality in Linux for Linux Mint.</p>

<p>This file will need to be dropped in <code>/usr/share/nemo/actions</code>, and it needs to have the extension <code>.nemo_action</code>.  Notice that I&rsquo;ve commented out the switch that will allow <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/wipe">wipe</a> to <code>chmod</code> files to remove them, as this could potentially be dangerous for some users. Use this switch if you want it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m making a website for my family reunion.  I found a couple good sites that had some examples of ASP.NET&rsquo;s FileUpload control, but I&rsquo;m going to post mine here so that anyone that finds it useful can use it. I&rsquo;m using Visual Studio 2012 and ASP.NET 4.5.</p>

<p>I wanted to be able to have the family upload files and I wanted to have them automatically sorted by what year we had the reunion, and by content type.  That would make it easier for me to set up ASP.NET membership security on the whole folder so that anonymous requested couldn&rsquo;t view the content.  It was also be easier to display the content later.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first installed elementaryOS Luna, the first critisism I had was &ldquo;Where is my minimize button?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After some Googling, I found a couple websites that told me to install <code>dconf-tools</code>.  This approach wasn&rsquo;t working for me, I would change <code>org &gt; pantheon &gt; desktop &gt; gala &gt; appearance &gt; button-layout</code> to <code>close, minimize:maximize</code>, but nothing would change.  Then I found a much easier way.</p>

<p>I installed <code>elementary-tweaks</code> as follows:</p>

<p><code>
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:versable/elementary-update<br />
sudo apt-get update<br />
sudo apt-get install elementary-tweaks
</code></p>

<p>Then I went to <code>System Settings &gt; Tweaks &gt; Appearance</code> and was presented with these options:</p>

<p><img src="http://toastymallows.github.io/images/Tweak-options.png" /></p>

<p>I of course chose the Windows layout, because that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m most comfortable with, but there are other options too, including OS X, Custom, Close Only, elementary, Minimize Right and Minimize Left.</p>

<p>If you want a good explaination on why the minimize button was left out of Luna, read <a href="http://elementaryos.org/journal/whats-window-controls">What&rsquo;s Up With Window Controls</a> and <a href="http://elementaryos.org/journal/whats-still-window-controls">What&rsquo;s (Still) Up With Window Controls?</a> by Daniel Foré, founder and lead designer of elementaryOS.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently opened up Adobe Premiere to see that it was crashing.  After debugging the error in Visual Studio, I found that it was crashing on aticfx64.dll.  Not sure what this file does, but I know it&rsquo;s for an AMD Radeon video card.</p>

<p>After Googling it for a little while, clearing old registry keys and uninstalling/reinstalling, it hit me.  I have 3 monitors hooked up, my video card only has two outputs in the back so I must be using the onboard video card as well.  Lo and behold when I unplugged the monitor that was using the on-board video card my problems were solved and it ran perfectly.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps someone.</p>

    <link href="http://toastymallows.github.io/family-reunions/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-09T21:11:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://toastymallows.github.io/family-reunions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year will be my 22<sup>nd</sup> family reunion.  That&rsquo;s one for every year I&rsquo;ve been alive.  Family reunions are a like second nature to me.  I&rsquo;ve asked a lot of my friends if they have family reunions, most of them said no.  Some commented that family was too far away to have a reunion every year, but I think it&rsquo;s important enough to make the trek.</p>

<p>One of my great aunt&rsquo;s husband comes to our family reunion every year.  He has a large family tree that he manages and he brings it every year to write down updates. Deaths, births, marriages and divorces all get recorded.  It&rsquo;s nice to have that solid of a family history written down and able to be referenced.  It gives me a great idea of where I come from and my place in the world.  Hopefully one day I can take over updating the tree.</p>

<p>Recently, my family found out that one of our ancestors lied about their nationality on an immigration form in the early 1900s.<!--more-->  Someone had visited <a href="http://Ancestry.com">Ancestry.com</a> and brought the printed out proof that a couple who was once thought to be 100% German, was now 50% German and 50% Polish.  To me this didn&rsquo;t make a difference, but for some (older) family members, it was a complete shock.</p>

<p>Times have changed I guess.  Nationality for me really isn&rsquo;t that important.  Eventually everything is going to be so mixed together that it would be pointless to care, but it&rsquo;s fun to learn where you&rsquo;re from.  For some family members that grew up in the 1930s, this was a game changer.  Imagine that you think your whole life that you&rsquo;re a certain percentage German (Maybe %50 or even %100), and now you&rsquo;re Polish as well.  If you didn&rsquo;t know, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-unloved-neighbors-a-history-of-hostility-between-poland-and-germany-a-489510.html">German-Polish relations aren&rsquo;t exactly rock solid</a>.  Just recently in 2005, the late Polish President Lech Kaczynski, when asked about his countries threats, responded by saying &ldquo;Threats? Those are our neighbors &ndash; Russia and Germany.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, family being family, everything eventually evened out.  The main reason I like going is to just see everyone that I would normally never see, or only see for happy/sad events (Christmas/Funerals respectively).  It&rsquo;s nice to get an update on how life is moving along for everyone.  A chance to relax, play some bocce ball, and enjoy some cheesy potatoes.</p>

<p>Do you have a family reunion?  If not, you should consider hosting one soon!  Since family is more spread out now-a-days, we always invite people that can&rsquo;t make it to send a message (snailmail/email) so that it can be read out during our annual meeting (to decide on dues for next year, location, time, family updates).  We have some casual guessing games, eat some food and enjoy eachothers company.  Who knows, maybe yours will still be going after 51 years like ours has!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Programming Ideas: Closed Source to Open Source]]></title>
    <link href="http://toastymallows.github.io/programming-ideas-closed-source-to-open-source/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-08T23:05:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://toastymallows.github.io/programming-ideas-closed-source-to-open-source</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was trying to rack my brain and think of some big programs that don&rsquo;t really have an open source equivilent.  I posed the question to one of my co-workers, at first he mentioned a couple of games.  I quickly told him to forget about games and focus on software.</p>

<p>I said &ldquo;Imagine if GIMP didn&rsquo;t exist as an open source alternative to Adobe Photoshop, that would be a good example.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pondered for a minute and he couldn&rsquo;t really come up with anything.</p>

<p>Do all programs have an open source alternative?<!--more--></p>

<p>After checking going through the list of programs I work with frequently I only found one, <a href="http://whatpulse.org/">Whatpulse</a>.  If you don&rsquo;t know what Whatpulse does, it tracks your mouseclicks and keyboard clicks and presents the data in a nice, reasonable fashion.  It isn&rsquo;t a keylogger, it just counts how many times keys and mouse buttons are pressed.  Later on mouse movement distance was added, as well as scroll wheel distance.</p>

<p>This data is then <em>pulsed</em> to their servers so that things are available on the web.  The site lets users have a dynamic image made so that people can display their stats.  In fact, I have one on my <a href="http://toastymallows.github.io/about">About</a> page.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons that the code isn&rsquo;t open source is that if it was, people would figure out how to cheat (simulate key presses and mouse clicks), and it would make the competing aspect pointless.  Some people don&rsquo;t use Whatpulse because they&rsquo;re worried about it actually being a keylogger (even though the software has been around for 10 years now and hasn&rsquo;t had one reported incident).</p>

<p>But, let&rsquo;s just assume that someone wants to run all of this on their local machine, and not pulse it to a webserver or anything else, I couldn&rsquo;t really find an alternative for just tracking how many key presses and mouse clicks you have.  This would be a great open source project for someone (maybe me) to start and pursue.</p>

<p>Damn, I&rsquo;ve been using Whatpulse for 9 years?</p>

    <link href="http://toastymallows.github.io/working-on-uncommented-code/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-07T22:37:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://toastymallows.github.io/working-on-uncommented-code</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m sure that all of you, if you&rsquo;re in the work force, are well aware that uncommented code is easy to come by.  In big applications and major software companies, as the program grows, so does the code.  And as the code grows, some or most of the code may start to become uncommented.  This may be from other programmers being</p>

<ul>
  <li>lazy (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll comment this later&rdquo;)</li>
  <li>forgetful</li>
  <li>pompus (&ldquo;My code is readable, it doesn&rsquo;t need comments!&rdquo;)</li>
  <li>unaware (&ldquo;This regex isn&rsquo;t that hard to follow&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p>and this is fine.  Things happen, hell even I&rsquo;ve made these mistakes a couple times.  But now you&rsquo;re a new hire to a company and your first task is to implement a feature that many customers have been demanding, but hasn&rsquo;t gathered enough momentum until you arrived.<!--more--></p>

<p>Monday morning after your first cup of coffee you start diving into the code.  After finding the area you&rsquo;ll be working in, you notice something.  <em>&ldquo;Where are the comments?&rdquo;</em>  Then it hits you like a ton of bricks, most of the code you&rsquo;ve been looking at isn&rsquo;t commented.  This isn&rsquo;t the worst feeling in the world but it definitely sucks.</p>

<p>What do you do?  Most of the people you&rsquo;re working with are busy, they don&rsquo;t have time to talk you through every section.  I&rsquo;ve been in this situation, and here&rsquo;s what I did.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Does your code build?  If so, run it.  This can easily help you pair up what you&rsquo;re seeing as output (GUI or not) with what is behind the scenes.  I know this seems like an easy solution, but having code that actually runs may be rare (especially with daily builds of software that is version controlled), so utilize it!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can you get you code to build?  Try it out.  This will give you a good feeling for the code you&rsquo;ll be working with, putting yourself in the old authors&rsquo; shoes.  Be sure to add comments when you figure things out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your code doesn&rsquo;t build, that&rsquo;s ok.  Start at your entry point (a button click event or <code>main()</code>) and work your way out, adding comments along the way.  These comments don&rsquo;t have to be in-depth, something like <code>#called from X</code> or <code>#this variable really does Y</code>.  This will help you later when you&rsquo;re adding new things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the old author still around?  If so, pick their brain.  Come to them with a detailed and straight-forward set of questions that you obtained after boiling down your code review.  They may not have enough time to talk to you about it so be breif!  The more detatched someone gets from the code they write the harder it is to recall the logic (&ldquo;I know I wrote this line for a reason..&rdquo;).  Hopefully they didn&rsquo;t just write it and move on to something else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Debug! If you&rsquo;re working in <code>Visual Studio</code>, <code>Eclipse</code> or even <code>Notepad++</code>, use the debugger to your advantage.  See a funky looking line?  Not sure what it does?  Run it and see what happens, then comment out the results.  If necessary, make changes to the code to increase readability later on.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw things out.  I often find that it&rsquo;s easier for me to visualize code when I make a rough sketch on paper.  Don&rsquo;t get wrapped up too much in the format (no UML!), just get something down that you can understand.  <a href="http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/68/does-writing-something-down-help-memorize-it">Sometimes having objects and method calls on paper can help you remember them.</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>All code paths end, and eventually the logic you&rsquo;re tracing will too.  Eventually you&rsquo;ll figure out everything you need to know to start working on that next big project.  </p>

<p>But before you forget, comment those changes you just made before lunchtime starts.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Of course this depends on you being able to run your program.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>

    <id>http://toastymallows.github.io/juggling-always-comes-in-handy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was at an intern picnic for lunch, celebrating the end of the summer for most interns.  I got tired of watching a group of people play Ultimate Frisbee and started juggling some of the Cornhole bags.</p>

<p>A couple of people said &ldquo;Wow that&rsquo;s pretty cool&rdquo;, &ldquo;How long did that take you?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Can you juggle chainsaws/fire/knives?&rdquo;.  Nothing I haven&rsquo;t heard before.  Juggling always brings these questions out from people.  Maybe they&rsquo;ve tried to juggle in the past and gave up (because they probably learned the wrong way) or they haven&rsquo;t tried before and always wanted to.</p>

<p>Then, out the blue, a fellow intern walks up and asks if I want to pass with him.  Like any juggler would, I said sure.  When we were passing we talked about where we learned how to juggle, our favorite patterns, etc.</p>

<p>It always suprises me how things that you have done all of your life people can instantly identify with.  It really makes the world a smaller place and in some cases helps break the ice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be posting more about juggling in the future.</p>

    <id>http://toastymallows.github.io/buy-a-megaphone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Going along with my previous post about Estate Sales, one of my best purchases was at one.  Buying a heavy-duty, vintage Megaphone.  I found it in the basement of someones house just waiting for me to purchase it, and I got it for $30.</p>

<p>At the time it seemed like a sizeable chunk of change to be throwing at something which would certainly be a novelty item or purely for entertainment, but it has come in handy a lot.</p>

<p>There are tons of times in your life where owning a Megaphone can help.  Throwing a big party?  Need to organize a rally of any sort?  Has someone asked you to help them at an organization or event?  Chances are you&rsquo;ll need a megaphone to grab everyones attention.  There have been times where people have literally said to me &ldquo;Man, I wish I had a megaphone for this&rdquo;, to which I respond that I do, indeed, have one readily available.</p>

<p>Is it used a lot for fun?  Sure.  My megaphone, in addition to projecting my voice very loudly, comes with some built in sounds (tons of siren noises from the US and UK), and is great for scaring the shit out of people.</p>

<p>All in all, if you ever have the chance to buy one, do it!  It will greatly improve your life.  Go for broke and get one that runs off of a lantern 6-volt battery and a microphone attached to a coiled cable.  Pretty soon you&rsquo;ll be renting it out to your friends.</p>

    <link href="http://toastymallows.github.io/go-to-your-local-estate-sales/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-04T23:32:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://toastymallows.github.io/go-to-your-local-estate-sales</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are anything like the people I&rsquo;ve met in my life thus far, you&rsquo;ve never been to an estate sale.  Do you collect things?  Do you want to furnish your new house?  Have you always wondered what the inside of your neighbors house looked like?  Do you just like old stuff?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, you would love going to the estate sales in your town.<!--more--></p>

<p>Estate sales are such a great place to get stuff for cheap.  And sometimes, even cheaper than thrift stores or garage sales.  </p>

<p>Consider this; You&rsquo;re hired to sell all of the contents of someones home after they have recently passed away or decided to move.  What do you do?  You don&rsquo;t want to price things too expensive or else people will never buy them, and you don&rsquo;t want to under sell something that you could have gotten double on.  Also, houses have <em>a lot</em> of things in them, especially if they&rsquo;ve been lived in for 30-40 years.  With this in mind, you&rsquo;ll probably price some items higher and expect to come down, yet on others you&rsquo;ll mark them low just to get them out of the door.  Others still, you&rsquo;ll just have people come up and ask what you&rsquo;ll take for it at the cash register during the sale.</p>

<p>This is exactly the situation that most estate sale runners are faced with, how much product to be left over at the end of the weekend.  The leftover items will most likely be liquidated (at a loss most likely, as everything will be sold in bulk to the highest bidder), or in some cases, donated to thrift stores (old books, vhs tapes, etc.)  So they want to sell you the items when you&rsquo;re there.</p>

<p>This is where you come in.  Compile a list of things that you would want to have (in my case: keychains, electronics, games, tchotchkes, weird or unique items, quick ebay sells), then peruse your local newspaper/Craigslist/<a href="http://www.estatesales.net/">estatesales.net</a> for the estate sales in your town that week.  Most likely there will be 3 or 4 going on that week, sometimes very close to your house.</p>

<p>Then, plan to visit them!  When looking around for stuff you want or need, remember that the people selling these items are trying to get items out the door.  They understand that you&rsquo;re looking for a deal, and in most cases, will happily bargin with you to get the best price for both of you.  The best deals are when both parties feel that they&rsquo;re winning with the price that&rsquo;s being negotiated.  When in doubt, use your common sense.  Ask questions to yourself like:  Is this worth it for the price?  Will I use this?  Could I get one brand new for less or the same price?  This questions and similar ones will guide you through most negotiations.</p>

<p>Some estate sales are tough.  Most things you see will be over priced, and you&rsquo;ll start getting freaked out, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don.27t_Panic">don&rsquo;t panic</a>!  Sometimes this is just to weed out the people who aren&rsquo;t serious buyers, other times, they just don&rsquo;t know how to price things.  Go through the sale like normal, pick up things that you like and start to bargin with the sale runners.  If they aren&rsquo;t budging, just calmly put the items down and walk away.  Most of the time, it&rsquo;s not worth the argument over prices.  </p>

<p>This is perhaps the worst part about estate sales, finding something cool and the sellers just aren&rsquo;t coming down on the price (even for trival things, kitchen ware, old books).  You&rsquo;ll have to make a judgement call for yourself if you ever get into this situation, pay the money or walk away?  Sometimes when the prices are too outrageous, I just leave and go to the next sale. You may be able to come back later in the week at the end of the sale to get the same thing for cheaper when the sellers are getting desperate sell things, but, you run the risk of someone else buying your item.  </p>

<p>It always kills me when I see sellers who are on the last day of their sale and have tons of things left to sell because they don&rsquo;t want to budge on any price.  What they don&rsquo;t understand is that if you&rsquo;re selling something secondhand, <em>you&rsquo;re never going to sell it at the original price, even if it&rsquo;s mint condition</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Something else I&rsquo;ve seen people do is always be connected on the phone with someone.  On the other end of the line is a friend or family member that is just searching Google/Ebay/Craigslist for the price of everything their friend is looking at.  Most of the time, these people are serious buyers and are willing to pay sticker price for something they know that they can turn around easily for a profit.  These people usually own a second hand store and/or care way too much about their Ebay rating.</p>

<p>I guarantee if you go out and use your best judgement you&rsquo;ll walk away with some items that you wanted for much less than you were willing to pay for.  In the end, even if you didn&rsquo;t get anything, it was probably fun just to go out and see everything that was for sale.  </p>

<p>Be assured that I&rsquo;ll be posting about estate sales and garage sales more in the future, as I&rsquo;ve been crusing them casually for 5+ years and found some awesome deals along the way.</p>

      <p>The only exception to this is if the item is rare or collectable, for example anything signed by a celebrity, Tiffany &amp; Co. items, certain types of jewlery and one-of-a-kind items like street signs, paintings by certain artists, etc.  These are rare finds and usually the seller is already aware of the items worth, thus the reason for the markup.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <link href="http://toastymallows.github.io/review-of-sky-zone-and-similar-places/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-03T23:59:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://toastymallows.github.io/review-of-sky-zone-and-similar-places</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those that don&rsquo;t know, <a href="http://www.skyzone.com/Westlake">Sky Zone</a> is a trampoline park that have locations around the US, one recently popped up in Westlake, OH, not far from my house.  Some friends and I decided to check it out.<!--more--></p>

<p>First of all, I would recommend that you go for the $14/hour offer and only get 1 hour to start out with.  Extending your stay is easy if you&rsquo;re having a good time.  After an hour (for me at least) you start to get a little tired, and the food there isn&rsquo;t exactly cheap.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in my early 20s, so jumping around for a little while is pretty easy, but eventually by the end of the hour, my back started to hurt, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p>When you go in, you&rsquo;ll probably see a lot of young kids, but Sky Zone takes all ages (that will sign or have a waiver signed for them).  Trampoline areas are split up by age, so you aren&rsquo;t jumping around young kids.  In addition to just a large trampoline area there is also a smaller dodgeball court, a foam pit and a basketball hoop, all carefully supervised.</p>

<p>Be sure to wear socks because you aren&rsquo;t wearing your own shoes.  Ankle length shoes are provided to all who enter.  After a while my ankle was tired of rubbing up against the shoes, as I&rsquo;m not used to wearing those types of shoes, so maybe put on some longer socks. Also, lockers to hold your loose items (cell phone, wallet, necklace, etc.) aren&rsquo;t free, but 25 cents is a reasonable price.</p>

<p>To sum up;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trampolines</li>
  <li>Foam pit was awesome</li>
  <li>Easy waiver process (you can even do it online)</li>
  <li>Area was very neat (saw people sanitizing things the whole time)</li>
  <li>Worth the money</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Music, recent pop hits/rap was played</li>
  <li>Ankle length shoes, though I see the reason behind them (harder to roll your ankle)</li>
  <li>Tons of rules, but again I see the reason</li>
  <li>Long wait in some areas (at peak times this could be longer)</li>
  <li>Lots of young children, again, understandable</li>
  <li>Trampolines are literally the only thing there, people who aren&rsquo;t jumping (read: parents) might get bored easily.  No TVs, arcade area, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, if you&rsquo;re looking for a place to jump on a bunch of trampolines, this is definitely the place to go.  I think the price is pretty reasonable, but if you&rsquo;re taking multiple children, this might change.  I would go back just for the foam pit.</p>

    <link href="http://toastymallows.github.io/frugal-roadtrip-advice/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-02T21:14:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://toastymallows.github.io/frugal-roadtrip-advice</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tend to be very frugal.  So when my girlfriend and I decided to go on a roadtrip after we were done with school I decided that we would do it as cheaply as possible.<!--more--></p>

<p>One of our biggest hangups early on was the fact that we didn&rsquo;t want to spend $70/night or more on a hotel or B&amp;B.  I saw on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/frugal">/r/frugal</a> that some WalMarts would let you sleep in your car in their parking lots overnight, either with a RV or just a regular car.</p>

<p>After reading many reviews and feedback from people who have done this, it&rsquo;s very hit or miss.  I read on <a href="http://themorningfresh.com/2012/06/29/a-guide-to-car-camping-in-walmart-parking-lots/">this guide</a> to WalMart parking lot camping that the founder of WalMart has been vocal about his stores providing a safe spot for people on the road to stay overnight.  Even with this, some WalMarts definitely <strong>do not</strong> let you sleep overnight in their parking lots.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>So I got to thinking, where could you park overnight and definitely <strong>not</strong> be bugged.  Then it hit me, hotel parking lots!  This provides a nice place to sleep during the night, lots are usually filled with many cars so you&rsquo;ll just blend in.  In the morning, go in and use the restroom, if it&rsquo;s a nice hotel get a free cup of coffee and be on your way!  I think it would be better if your car had some tinted windows in the back, at least for a small bit of privacy.  In addition, you could put a foldable sunshade in the front windsheild for even more privacy.</p>

<p>I imagine that we&rsquo;ll be using this a lot on our roadtrip.  We plan on leaving the week of August 19th, 2013.  During the roadtrip and some more before I&rsquo;ll be sure to share any plans we have of saving some money and seeing the country!</p>

    <link href="http://toastymallows.github.io/why-i-started-using-google-bookmarks/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-01T19:36:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://toastymallows.github.io/why-i-started-using-google-bookmarks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I never really used bookmarks a while ago, I would just try to remember everything.  Every funny website, good recipe and JavaScript framework I found would just be stored away, soon to be forgotten.  Then I would end up taking 10 or 15 minutes to find it again a month later.  The worst part was, when I did actually try to use bookmark managers in web browsers, I would end up reformatting my computer and forgetting to back them up.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/bookmarks/">Google Bookmarks</a> greatly simplified this.  No longer do you have to use a bunch of nested folders to categorize your bookmarks, some in Firefox, some in Chrome.  Google takes all of your cat GIFs and lets you assign tags to them, making them easily searchable later when you want to show your friends.</p>

<p>Being Google, they give you a great way to export your bookmarks to a HTML file for your convenience, or if you&rsquo;re tired of Google.</p>

<p>One of the best parts is there is a button that you can drag into the bookmark bar in the browser of your choice to bookmark the page you&rsquo;re currently on to the Google account you&rsquo;re currently logged in to.  This makes it easy to be more mobile with your bookmarks.</p>

<p>What was that?  You find it weird that you have to still use a browser bookmark to save your new bookmarks?  Yeah ok, move along kid.</p>

    <id>http://toastymallows.github.io/p0606-obd-ii-code-on-a-2008-toyota-camry</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days ago I had some lights come up on the dash of my 2008 Toyota Camry.  The slip indicator, VSC and Check Engine lights were on.  First I did a quick check of my gas cap to see if it was sealed completely, because this is one of the common reasons why a check engine light would be on.
<!-- more -->
After checking that, I went to my local AutoZone to get the code read.  The code that came up was P0606: PCM/ECM Processor Fault<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.  The guy that helped me read my code seemed very confused as to why this code was coming up on such a new model of car.  He asked if I recently installed any new stereo systems or speakers, to which I said no.</p>

<p>Knowingly or not, he reset the code on my car.  Upon returning home to research this code further I couldn&rsquo;t find anything that specific to my model car.  Luckily I found <a href="http://www.xr-underground.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-1692.html">this blog post</a> from a couple Google searches.  User <em>blackx-runner</em> described the same problem that I was having, although I didn&rsquo;t notice my car reacting any different when on the road.  Recently we&rsquo;ve had a lot of rain here and he said that he noticed his truck getting the error after a carwash or heavy rain.  I&rsquo;ve had my car outside a lot so I think my issue may be related to this.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep this blog post updated with any problems I have with this problem, but for now a simple reset seems to have fixed it.</p>

<p><strong>Update 16 Oct. 2013</strong> - Still haven&rsquo;t had the problem come back.  Looks like it was just a fluke.</p>

<p><strong>Update 23 Dec. 2013</strong> - Just had the error code happen again. It rained for about 2 days straight in Cleveland, I think that&rsquo;s what caused it, though I can&rsquo;t be sure. But this time it came with a bonus error code, P0138.  </p>

<p>Found a couple resources online, <a href="http://ww2.justanswer.com/uploads/snd27613/2008-10-22_002248_p0171.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.toyotanation.com/forum/104-5th-6th-generation-2002-2006-2007-2011/337271-07-camry-v6-p0138-o2-sensor.html">here</a>.  According to the first link, the official Toyota PDF from 2008, it&rsquo;s an issue that is covered under warrenty for 36 months or 36,000 miles, which I&rsquo;m over both.</p>

<p>The second link, the ToyotaNation.com forum, user <em>yukon700</em> has the same problem as me, only his car is a 2007 Camry.  He says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After researching and talking to a friend he said I should just go to autozone and replace the O2 sensor which failed due to high voltage which is behind the catalytic converter and see if that works. Toyota warns that I need to replace everything and by just replacing the one sensor it will fry again and be a waste.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to take it to my mechanic and see what he says about all of this.</p>
