    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was at an intern picnic for lunch, celebrating the end of the summer for most interns.  I got tired of watching a group of people play Ultimate Frisbee and started juggling some of the Cornhole bags.</p>

<p>A couple of people said &ldquo;Wow that&rsquo;s pretty cool&rdquo;, &ldquo;How long did that take you?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Can you juggle chainsaws/fire/knives?&rdquo;.  Nothing I haven&rsquo;t heard before.  Juggling always brings these questions out from people.  Maybe they&rsquo;ve tried to juggle in the past and gave up (because they probably learned the wrong way) or they haven&rsquo;t tried before and always wanted to.</p>

<p>Then, out the blue, a fellow intern walks up and asks if I want to pass with him.  Like any juggler would, I said sure.  When we were passing we talked about where we learned how to juggle, our favorite patterns, etc.</p>

<p>It always suprises me how things that you have done all of your life people can instantly identify with.  It really makes the world a smaller place and in some cases helps break the ice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be posting more about juggling in the future.</p>
