    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was at an intern picnic for lunch, celebrating the end of the summer for most interns.  I got tired of watching a group of people play Ultimate Frisbee and started juggling some of the Cornhole bags.</p>

<p>A couple of people said “Wow that’s pretty cool”, “How long did that take you?”, “Can you juggle chainsaws/fire/knives?”.  Nothing I haven’t heard before.  Juggling always brings these questions out from people.  Maybe they’ve tried to juggle in the past and gave up (because they probably learned the wrong way) or they haven’t tried before and always wanted to.</p>

<p>Then, out the blue, a fellow intern walks up and asks if I want to pass with him.  Like any juggler would, I said sure.  When we were passing we talked about where we learned how to juggle, our favorite patterns, etc.</p>

<p>It always suprises me how things that you have done all of your life people can instantly identify with.  It really makes the world a smaller place and in some cases helps break the ice.</p>

<p>I’ll be posting more about juggling in the future.</p>
