    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those that don&rsquo;t know, <a href="http://www.skyzone.com/Westlake">Sky Zone</a> is a trampoline park that have locations around the US, one recently popped up in Westlake, OH, not far from my house.  Some friends and I decided to check it out.<!--more--></p>

<p>First of all, I would recommend that you go for the $14/hour offer and only get 1 hour to start out with.  Extending your stay is easy if you&rsquo;re having a good time.  After an hour (for me at least) you start to get a little tired, and the food there isn&rsquo;t exactly cheap.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in my early 20s, so jumping around for a little while is pretty easy, but eventually by the end of the hour, my back started to hurt, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p>When you go in, you&rsquo;ll probably see a lot of young kids, but Sky Zone takes all ages (that will sign or have a waiver signed for them).  Trampoline areas are split up by age, so you aren&rsquo;t jumping around young kids.  In addition to just a large trampoline area there is also a smaller dodgeball court, a foam pit and a basketball hoop, all carefully supervised.</p>

<p>Be sure to wear socks because you aren&rsquo;t wearing your own shoes.  Ankle length shoes are provided to all who enter.  After a while my ankle was tired of rubbing up against the shoes, as I&rsquo;m not used to wearing those types of shoes, so maybe put on some longer socks. Also, lockers to hold your loose items (cell phone, wallet, necklace, etc.) aren&rsquo;t free, but 25 cents is a reasonable price.</p>

<p>To sum up;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trampolines</li>
  <li>Foam pit was awesome</li>
  <li>Easy waiver process (you can even do it online)</li>
  <li>Area was very neat (saw people sanitizing things the whole time)</li>
  <li>Worth the money</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Music, recent pop hits/rap was played</li>
  <li>Ankle length shoes, though I see the reason behind them (harder to roll your ankle)</li>
  <li>Tons of rules, but again I see the reason</li>
  <li>Long wait in some areas (at peak times this could be longer)</li>
  <li>Lots of young children, again, understandable</li>
  <li>Trampolines are literally the only thing there, people who aren&rsquo;t jumping (read: parents) might get bored easily.  No TVs, arcade area, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, if you&rsquo;re looking for a place to jump on a bunch of trampolines, this is definitely the place to go.  I think the price is pretty reasonable, but if you&rsquo;re taking multiple children, this might change.  I would go back just for the foam pit.</p>
