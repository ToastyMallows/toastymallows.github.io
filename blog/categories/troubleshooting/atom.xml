    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently opened up Adobe Premiere to see that it was crashing.  After debugging the error in Visual Studio, I found that it was crashing on aticfx64.dll.  Not sure what this file does, but I know itâ€™s for an AMD Radeon video card.</p>

<p>After Googling it for a little while, clearing old registry keys and uninstalling/reinstalling, it hit me.  I have 3 monitors hooked up, my video card only has two outputs in the back so I must be using the onboard video card as well.  Lo and behold when I unplugged the monitor that was using the on-board video card my problems were solved and it ran perfectly.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps someone.</p>
