    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 8.1 and I noticed that my system would beep loudly or ring its system bell when I scrolled my mouse wheel really fast.  I think that it is compounded by the fact that I have a <a href="http://support.logitech.com/product/gaming-mouse-g500">gaming mouse</a>, which allows me to spin the scroll wheel to simulate infinite scrolling.  Here’s how to turn it off in Windows 8.1.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open Registry Edit (Win + R, type regedit, hit enter)</li>
  <li>Navigate to <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Beep</code></li>
  <li>Double click on the key <code>Start</code></li>
  <li>Change the value from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>4</strong></li>
  <li>Reboot</li>
</ol>

<p>Now when you scroll your scroll wheel really quickly, you won’t hear that annoying beep anymore!  I’m still not sure exactly what causes the beep, because it only happens in some applications.  For example, it won’t happen in Google Chrome if I scroll on a webpage really quickly, but it will happen if I scroll inside of Spotify.  If anyone has more information abot this I’d be curious to hear what it is!</p>
