			Programming Ideas: Closed Source to Open Source</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today I was trying to rack my brain and think of some big programs that don’t really have an open source equivilent.  I posed the question to one of my co-workers, at first he mentioned a couple of games.  I quickly told him to forget about games and focus on software.</p>

<p>I said “Imagine if GIMP didn’t exist as an open source alternative to Adobe Photoshop, that would be a good example.”</p>

<p>He pondered for a minute and he couldn’t really come up with anything.</p>

<p>Do all programs have an open source alternative?

			Working on Uncommented Code</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I’m sure that all of you, if you’re in the work force, are well aware that uncommented code is easy to come by.  In big applications and major software companies, as the program grows, so does the code.  And as the code grows, some or most of the code may start to become uncommented.  This may be from other programmers being</p>

<ul>
  <li>lazy (“I’ll comment this later”)</li>
  <li>forgetful</li>
  <li>pompus (“My code is readable, it doesn’t need comments!”)</li>
  <li>unaware (“This regex isn’t that hard to follow”)</li>
</ul>

<p>and this is fine.  Things happen, hell even I’ve made these mistakes a couple times.  But now you’re a new hire to a company and your first task is to implement a feature that many customers have been demanding, but hasn’t gathered enough momentum until you arrived.

			Juggling Always Comes in Handy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today I was at an intern picnic for lunch, celebrating the end of the summer for most interns.  I got tired of watching a group of people play Ultimate Frisbee and started juggling some of the Cornhole bags.</p>

<p>A couple of people said “Wow that’s pretty cool”, “How long did that take you?”, “Can you juggle chainsaws/fire/knives?”.  Nothing I haven’t heard before.  Juggling always brings these questions out from people.  Maybe they’ve tried to juggle in the past and gave up (because they probably learned the wrong way) or they haven’t tried before and always wanted to.</p>

<p>Then, out the blue, a fellow intern walks up and asks if I want to pass with him.  Like any juggler would, I said sure.  When we were passing we talked about where we learned how to juggle, our favorite patterns, etc.</p>

<p>It always suprises me how things that you have done all of your life people can instantly identify with.  It really makes the world a smaller place and in some cases helps break the ice.</p>

<p>I’ll be posting more about juggling in the future.</p>

			Buy a Megaphone</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Going along with my previous post about Estate Sales, one of my best purchases was at one.  Buying a heavy-duty, vintage Megaphone.  I found it in the basement of someones house just waiting for me to purchase it, and I got it for $30.</p>

<p>At the time it seemed like a sizeable chunk of change to be throwing at something which would certainly be a novelty item or purely for entertainment, but it has come in handy a lot.</p>

<p>There are tons of times in your life where owning a Megaphone can help.  Throwing a big party?  Need to organize a rally of any sort?  Has someone asked you to help them at an organization or event?  Chances are you’ll need a megaphone to grab everyones attention.  There have been times where people have literally said to me “Man, I wish I had a megaphone for this”, to which I respond that I do, indeed, have one readily available.</p>

<p>Is it used a lot for fun?  Sure.  My megaphone, in addition to projecting my voice very loudly, comes with some built in sounds (tons of siren noises from the US and UK), and is great for scaring the shit out of people.</p>

<p>All in all, if you ever have the chance to buy one, do it!  It will greatly improve your life.  Go for broke and get one that runs off of a lantern 6-volt battery and a microphone attached to a coiled cable.  Pretty soon you’ll be renting it out to your friends.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If you are anything like the people I’ve met in my life thus far, you’ve never been to an estate sale.  Do you collect things?  Do you want to furnish your new house?  Have you always wondered what the inside of your neighbors house looked like?  Do you just like old stuff?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, you would love going to the estate sales in your town.
